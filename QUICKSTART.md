2. Restart your computer
3. Try Step 1 again

### Terminal won't let me type
**Fix**: The previous command is still running
- Press `Ctrl + C` to stop it
- Try again

### Port 3000 is already in use
**Fix**: You already have something running on port 3000
- Close any other terminals
- Restart VS Code
- Try `npm run dev` again

### I see errors in red text
**Fix**: 
1. Make sure you're in the correct folder (you should see `anime-streaming-site` in the terminal path)
2. Try `npm install` again
3. Close VS Code and reopen it

## 📝 What You Just Learned

Even though it seems simple, you just:

✅ Installed a development environment (Node.js + VS Code)
✅ Used the command line (Terminal)
✅ Installed dependencies with a package manager (npm)
✅ Started a development server
✅ Ran a React/Next.js application

These are professional developer skills! 🎓

## 🚀 Next Steps

Now that it's working, you can:

1. **Explore the code**
   - Click files in the left sidebar of VS Code
   - See how they connect together

2. **Make small changes**
   - Try changing "AnimeStream" to your own name
   - Change some colors
   - Save the file and watch it update in your browser!

3. **Read the main README.md**
   - It has more detailed explanations
   - Shows you how to customize things
   - Explains how to deploy your site online

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Stopping the server**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal
- **Starting again**: Run `npm run dev`
